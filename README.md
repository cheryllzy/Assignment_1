# Project Name: Craigslist

Craigslist was founded in 1995 by Craig Newmark, and developed initially as a free-to-use online hub to inform people of local events. Eventually, individuals began using the platform to post jobs, services, items for sale, and more, eventually evolving into aclassified advertisements website.

# Design Process

My project will help users to find/provide listings for services that they may require through the website. The design of the original website is quite old school and basic, making it not very appealing to users. My version has been revamped to improve the user experience by changing the layout to be more aesthetically pleasing, and the design of the website has been simplified to allow easier readability and navigation. Furthermore, the colours and fonts have been revised to be more modern and simplistic. All in all, this will allow users to find and provide the services they require more efficiently.

As a user type, I would want the website to be easier to navigate and less messy overall. I would also like the website to be more modern so that younger generations would be able to use the website as well. I would also like to improve the functionality of the website to be able to cater to the users better.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
